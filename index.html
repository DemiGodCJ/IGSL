                <div class="text-section" style="padding-right: 5rem;">
                    <p>My name is <strong>Charles Joshua Chakma</strong>, and I was born and raised in Chandraghona,
                        Chittagong, Bangladesh. Growing up in a Christian family in a predominantly Muslim country, I
                        faced many challenges. In Bangladesh, Christianity makes up only about 0.4% of the population,
                        and as a child, I mixed with people of different faiths in educational institutions and my
                        neighbourhood. Despite these challenges, my family's dedication to ministry has greatly
                        influenced my faith and inspired me to deepen my relationship with Christ.
                        <br>I have completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, which has equipped me with
                        valuable technical skills. However, my true passion lies in serving God and sharing His message.
                        Growing up with a father who is a pastor and a mother who is a devoted woman leader has played
                        an important role in shaping the person I am today.

                <div class="text-section text-left" style="padding-left: 5rem;">
                    <p>From a young age, I followed Christian traditions faithfully, and my parents were perfect role
                        models. However, as I grew older and encountered people from different backgrounds, I slowly
                        drifted away from the Lord. My devotion became more about routine and pride, wanting to impress
                        others with my biblical knowledge, rather than a genuine relationship with Christ. I was deeply
                        proud of my faith and saw it as something that made me better than others. But the true
                        transformation came when God opened my eyes to the reality that my relationship with Him was
                        missing the depth of love and humility. It was in that moment that I truly understood the
                        gospel, and my heart broke as I realized I had been living for myself instead of for God. I
                        repented and surrendered my life to Him, seeking not only His forgiveness but also His guidance
                        in becoming a faithful follower. I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior and was baptized in 2020
                        at the age of 20. My journey of faith continues, and I strive to grow in humility, desiring a
                        deeper relationship with God and to live according to His will.</p>

            <h2>My Vision for The Kingdom</h2>
            <div class="text-section">
                <p>My vision is to become a passionate servant of Christ, growing in both my knowledge and character. I
                    desire to be a leader who leads by example, pointing people to Christ through my actions and words.
                    I want to be someone who loves deeply, listens with compassion, and shares the gospel with humility.
                    Through continual growth in both knowledge and character, I aim to guide others to a deeper
                    understanding of God’s message and their purpose in His Kingdom.
                    <br>As I live in a modern age, I also dream of using my technical skills to connect with people through
                    social media and online platforms. Since many in Bangladesh primarily understand Bangla, I want to
                    create a social media platform that provides easy Bangla translations. My future goal is to build a
                    dedicated team that will work alongside me to translate foreign-language sermons, lectures, and
                    gospel messages into Bangla, ensuring that everyone can access and understand the truth of God’s
                    Word in their heart language.
                    <br>This platform will serve as a lifeline for those who do not have a church nearby or cannot attend
                    one for various reasons. Additionally, many Muslims converts in Bangladesh face persecution and
                    cannot openly proclaim their faith in Christ without severe consequences. For them, this platform
                    will provide a safe space where they can attend an online church, receive spiritual nourishment, and
                    grow in their faith without fear.
                    <br>I believe that by living with grace and unwavering faith, I can help others experience the
                    transformative power of God’s love, just as I have. My heart’s desire is to equip others to walk in
                    the fullness of their faith, whether they are new to Christianity or have been walking with the Lord
                    for many years. I long to see a world where people are not just aware of Christ but truly know
                    Him—living in relationship with Him and fully embracing the purpose He has for them.

            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <div class="text-section">
                <p>In Bangladesh, Muslims constitute about 91% of the population, and Christianity remains a minority
                    faith. Unfortunately, misconceptions about Jesus and Christianity are widespread among the Muslim
                    population. Many of my Muslim friends and neighbors have misconceptions about who Jesus is, and
                    often, they are taught a distorted version of His identity. These misconceptions, along with
                    stereotypes and misunderstandings, make it challenging to have open conversations about faith. But I
                    see a significant opportunity to bridge these gaps and reach out to those who have not yet
                    encountered the truth. I am deeply burdened for the Muslim people of Bangladesh and feel a strong
                    calling to engage with them in love and humility. Through sharing the message of Jesus, I hope to
                    address these misconceptions and promote a more accurate understanding of Christianity. I believe
                    that by breaking down barriers of misunderstanding and showing them the truth of who Jesus really
                    is, I can help lead them to faith in Him. As it is written in Matthew 28:19-20, “Go therefore and
                    make disciples of all nations... teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you,” I believe
                    it is my responsibility to reach out to those who have not yet heard the truth, particularly those
                    in my community who have never had the opportunity to understand who Jesus is.</p>

            <h2>My Inspiration to Work with God</h2>
            <div class="text-section">
                <p>I have always felt a deep calling to serve God, and my heart has been drawn to His Word. I’ve
                    experienced firsthand the transformative power of His love in my life. From a young age, I’ve had a
                    strong desire to share the truth of the Bible, particularly with those in my community who may have
                    misconceptions about who Jesus is. I believe God’s message is life-changing, and my passion is to be
                    an instrument of His love and truth.
                    My inspiration comes from witnessing the transformation in my parents after they completed their
                    theology program at IGSL. Their journey not only deepened their knowledge but also shaped their
                    character, and I long to experience that same growth. For me, working for God is not just about
                    preaching but about living a life that reflects His love, engaging with others in a way that brings
                    hope, healing, and understanding.
                    I aspire to be a spiritual leader who listens with empathy, speaks with wisdom, and offers counsel
                    that leads to lasting transformation. My calling is rooted in a deep sense of responsibility and
                    gratitude. I want to serve God with all my heart, knowing that my efforts contribute to fulfilling
                    His purpose and helping others find the hope and peace only He can provide.
                    Ultimately, it’s not about seeking my own glory but being faithful to the calling God has placed on
                    my life. I believe He has called me to be worthy of His purpose, to carry His light, and to lead
                    others across the bridge to life in Him.</p>

                    <div class="modal-body">
                        <p>I have chosen IGSL (International Graduate School of Leadership) in the Philippines for my
                            Master of Divinity because it aligns perfectly with my calling and vision. IGSL is not just
                            an institution—it is a training ground for leaders who are deeply rooted in biblical truth
                            and passionate about transforming lives.
                            <br>One of the primary reasons I am drawn to IGSL is the profound impact it had on my
                            parents. Their time at IGSL deepened their theological understanding, refined their
                            spiritual leadership, and equipped them to serve with wisdom and humility. Seeing their
                            transformation solidified my conviction that IGSL is the right place for me to grow in both
                            knowledge and character.
                            At IGSL, I know that I will receive:
                            <br>• A strong theological foundation to preach and teach with clarity and conviction.
                            <br>• Spiritual formation that nurtures my heart and character for long-term ministry.
                            <br>• Practical leadership training to engage in real-world evangelism and discipleship.
                            <br>• Cross-cultural exposure that will help me effectively minister in Bangladesh’s diverse
                            religious landscape.
                            <br>This journey is not just about academic learning—it is about being equipped for a
                            lifetime of impactful ministry. I am excited about the opportunity to learn, grow, and
                            prepare for the unique calling God has placed on my life. My heart’s desire is to be a
                            faithful servant, fully prepared to share the gospel and disciple others for the glory of
                            God.

                        <p>This journey to IGSL is a step of faith, marking the beginning of growth, transformation, and
                            service. The knowledge I gain will not only shape my life but also equip me to serve others
                            effectively. It is my passion to be a messenger of God’s love and wisdom, and I trust this
                            experience will help me fulfil that calling.
                            <br>I am called to share the truth of Jesus with the Muslim population in Bangladesh, where
                            He is often misunderstood and misrepresented. Through this mission, I aim to break down
                            misconceptions and help others understand who Jesus truly is.
                            As I prepare for this journey, I face challenges. The costs for pursuing my Master of
                            Divinity at IGSL in the Philippines include:
                            <br>• Airfare (one-way): 60,000 BDT (500 USD)
                            <br>• Visa Process: 10,000 BDT (100 USD)
                            <br>• Food and Accommodation: 300 USD/month
                            <br>As I face these challenges, there are moments when I feel the weight of responsibility,
                            and the temptation to find a job to support my family grows stronger. Yet, in these times of
                            uncertainty, I am reminded of God's faithfulness. Philippians 4:19 reassures me, "And my God
                            will supply every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus." I hold on
                            to the promise in Matthew 6:33, "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all
                            these things will be given to you as well."
                            I humbly ask for your prayers and support. Your encouragement is more than a financial
                            gift—it’s a partnership in helping me grow and serve others for God’s glory. May the Lord
                            bless you abundantly for your kindness.
